There are 2 different ways to configure which configsets you want blueprints to use.

1. [Project]({% link _docs/configsets/configure/project.md %}): Project configsets are configured by you at the project-level.
2. [Blueprint]({% link _docs/configsets/configure/blueprint.md %}): Blueprint configsets are configured within the blueprint code itself.
