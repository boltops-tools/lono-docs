title: Lono Help
---

You can run help for quick help information right at the CLI.  Example:

```sh
lono help
```

You can append `help`, `-h` or `--help` to the end of any command to get more helpful information about that specific command.  These all work.

```sh
lono new -h
lono build -h
lono summary -h
lono up -h
lono down -h
```
