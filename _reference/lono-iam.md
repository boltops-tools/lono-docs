Generate IAM policy

## Examples

    $ lono down demo
    Are you sure you want to delete the demo-dev stack? (y/N)
    y
    Deleted demo-dev stack.
    $

Lono prompts you with an "Are you sure?" message before the stack gets deleted.  If you would like to bypass the prompt, you can use the `-y` flag.

    $ lono down demo -y
    Deleted demo-dev stack.
    $
